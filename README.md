## Synopsis

Problems that I have solved on CodeWars
My CodeWars username is https://www.codewars.com/users/abid786

## Motivation

There are two files here - EasierProblems.py and HarderProblems.py. The former has problems labelled 5-8 kyu on CodeWars, whereas the latter lists those from 1-4 kyu.
CodeWars problems get you thinking algorithmically, and often serve as useful tools to incorporate the generated code into other projects (for example, the molecule parser)

## Updates

This repository will be updated occasionally with newer problems, as I solve them!
